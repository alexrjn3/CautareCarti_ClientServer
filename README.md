Files:
- Server.java – handles multiple connections and sends responses.
- FirClient.java – runs on a separate thread for each connected client.
- Client.java – the user interface; sends requests to the server.

Steps:
- The client sends a request (author + title).
- The server processes the request, searches for the book in a file, and returns the response.
- Supports multiple clients simultaneously.
- Communication is done via TCP sockets. 

A networked application with real-time interaction between clients and the server.
